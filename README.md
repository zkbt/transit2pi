# transit2pi-experiment
This is a set of experiments for developing a set of tools for visualizing transit light curves in a planetarium dome, to take advantage of a very big, 360 degree display! It is a collaboration between Taylor Washington and Zach Berta-Thompson.

We're using this space for experimenting and playing with scripts. As we develop components that we really like, we will transfer them over to a more official repository, where we'll be a bit more careful about making sure other folks can install our scripts.
