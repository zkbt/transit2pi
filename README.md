# transit2pi-experiment
This is a set of experiments for developing a set of tools for visualizing transit light curves in a planetarium dome, to take advantage of a very big, 360 degree display! It is a collaboration between Taylor Washington and Zach Berta-Thompson.

## Installation
If you want to be able to modify the code yourself, please fork/clone this repository onto your own computer and install directly from that editable package. For example, this might look like:
```
git clone https://github.com/zkbt/transit2pi-experiments.git
cd transit2pi-experiments/
pip install -e .
```
This will link the installed version of the `transit2pi` package to your local repository. Changes you make to the code in the repository should be reflected in the version Python sees when it tries to `import transit2pi`.
