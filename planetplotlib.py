'''
This is a small set of tools that extends matplotlib to be a bit better
for making plots that look nice in a planetarium dome.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def create_dome_plot(dpi=100, hideticks=True):
    '''
    This function creates a matplotlib figure that
    has a dark background and that is stretched out
    so it will span a full 360x10 degree strip on
    the dome.
    Parameters
    ----------
    dpi : int
        The number of dots per "inch".
        By default, a figure is 36x1 inches in
        size, so dpi=100 means you will create
        an image with 3600x100 pixels.
    hideticks : bool
        Should we hide the ticks and all the
        x and y labels?
    Returns
    -------
    ax : matplotlib.axes object
        This is a matplotlib axes, into which
        data can be plotted. By default, this function
        will set the current axes to this one, so
        "plt.plot", "plt.xlim" (...) commands will
        apply to it. You could also use "ax.plot",
        "ax.set_xlim", (...) to interact directly
        with the ax.
